                    <p class="citypara">India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic
                        variety
                        and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress during the last 65
                        years of its Independence. India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is
                        now
                        one of the top industrialized countries in the world and one of the few nations to have gone
                        into
                        outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq.
                        km,
                        extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As
                        the
                        7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is
                        by
                        mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the
                        Great
                        Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the
                        Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you
                        travel,
                        India offers a range of vast tourism choices, diverse in land and nature, people, tribes,
                        cuisine,
                        faiths, dance forms, music, arts, crafts, adventure, sport, spirituality, history; even these
                        vary
                        as you journey from one state to another. As a country, India has achieved all-round
                        socio-economic
                        progress in the last 70 years of independence. The change is clearly visible in the Tier I and
                        Tier
                        II cities. However, the fascinating aspect lies in the stark difference as you travel through
                        the
                        new and old parts of its cities. From world-class airports and hotels, luxurious shopping malls,
                        restaurants, pubs and cafes to overcrowded streets and alleyways, in the same cities, filled
                        with
                        thousands of little shops offering every possible modern and ethnic product and native street
                        food
                        is a fascinating experience.</p>

                        <br>
                        The Indian Peninsula stands apart from the rest of Asia, bordered as it is by mountains and the
                        sea, which gives the country a distinct geographical entity. Based on the phases of evolution of
                        the country and its people the history of India can be categorised in three major categories:
                        <br> <br>

                        <b> <i>Ancient History</i> </b> <br>
                        <br>
                        India's history and culture is dynamic, spanning back to the beginning of human civilization. It
                        begins with a mysterious culture along the Indus River and in farming communities in the
                        southern lands of India. The history of India is punctuated by constant integration of migrating
                        people with the diverse cultures that surround India. Available evidence suggests that the use
                        of iron, copper and other metals was widely prevalent in the Indian sub-continent at a fairly
                        early period, which is indicative of the progress that this part of the world had made. By the
                        end of the fourth millennium BC, India had emerged as a region of highly developed civilization.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b> <i> Medieval History</i> </b> <br>
                        <br>
                        For a period that has come to be so strongly associated with the Islamic influence and rule in
                        India, Medieval Indian history went for almost three whole centuries under the so-called
                        indigenous rulers, that included the Chalukyas, the Pallavas, the Pandyas, the Rashtrakutas, the
                        Muslims rulers and finally the Mughal Empire. The most important dynasty to emerge in the middle
                        of the 9th century was that of the Cholas.

                        <b>LIFE OF BUDDHA</b> <br>
                        <br>

                        According to legends, The Buddha, or "enlightened one," was a simple boy names Siddhartha
                        Gautam, born to the rulers of Shakya clan. His early childhood was spent in a lavish,
                        comfortable palace, wherein he was completely unaware of the suffering, pain and struggles of
                        the common world. Once on a short excursion to his city he witnessed several incidents that
                        acquainted him with the suffering of different people. He got extremely troubled knowing the
                        other facet of life and left home to explore more such questions he hadn’t personally
                        experienced, determined to lead an aesthetic life thereafter.

                        For several years, he adapted the ascetic life with full zeal and partook it’s challenges with a
                        brave face. He meditated for weeks to find answers to all his questions and the determination
                        was answered as “enlightement” under the Bodhi tree one fine day.
                        Buddhism is a religion, or better put dharma that propagates mindful meditation, powerful
                        living- free from materialistic desires and has set an array of approaches, practises, beliefs,
                        art and literature to claim that there’s alleviation possible from the pain and suffering
                        inflicted upon mankind.

                        It encourages people to opt for a “lifestyle” that appreciates life as it is and inviting them
                        on self-exploration to learn life teachings through practicing moral principles. Following
                        Buddha’s teaching, a person learns to protect himself/herself from all suffering and problems.
                        Buddhism states that the quality of life is not established by external development or progress
                        in materialistic possessions, but instead it’s the inner development that assures peace and
                        happiness in life of a person.
