                        <p class="citypara">Virginal Arunachal Pradesh appears as a giant patch of green on India’s map.
                            The country's wildest and least explored state, Arunachal (literally, Land of Dawn-Lit
                            Mountains) rises abruptly from the Assam plains as a mass of improbably steep and densely
                            forested hills, culminating in snowcapped peaks along the Tibetan border. Arunachal lures
                            travellers with the promise of adventurous journeys to remote mountain valleys and
                            encounters with some of its 26 indigenous tribal peoples. Tourism infrastructure – such as
                            hotels or even homestays – has yet to reach many areas; this is travel far beyond standard
                            tourist trails.

                            known for its national parks abounding in rhinoceroses, elephants, deer and primates (with
                            respectable tiger numbers too), it welcomes visitors with a subtly flavoured cuisine and a
                            hospitable population with a vibrant artistic heritage. The archetypal Assamese landscape is
                            a golden-green panorama of rice fields and manicured tea estates, framed by the blue
                            mountains of Arunachal Pradesh in the north and the highlands of Meghalaya and Nagaland to
                            the south. The birthplace of Indian tea, Assam has more than 3000 sq km of land carpeted in
                            bright-green tea gardens, and visits to these estates are high on many travellers'

                            abound. More interestingly, it’s home to 42 different tribes whose pointillist paintings and
                            spindly sculptures are as vivid as the colourful haats that take place across the region,

                            architecture, the countryside holds most of the state’s many treasures. Artisans in tribal

                            Though its creation as a separate state dates to a relatively recent 1966, when it was
                            carved out from the post-Partition Indian state of East Punjab, this burgeoning region was
                            the setting for several pivotal events in the history of northern India. Despite this,
                            modern Haryana is home to very few sights that truly appeal to foreign tourists. Bordering
                            Delhi to the west and northwest, with vast agricultural expanses and booming industrial
                            hotspots, most of the state lies beyond the tourism radar.Haryana has more to offer. Also
                            known as the Green Land of India, Haryana not only has a rich past but a great present and a
                            promising future too. This 16th largest state in India ranks amongst the leading
                            industrialized states in the country. It is a major producer and supplier of agricultural
                            products in India.

                            by bus, car, motorbike, jeep or foot. Every pass crossing into a new valley brings you into
                            a different culture, with its own deities and language. Villages perched on staggering

                            border with Myanmar. It's a place of great geographical and cultural variety. The capital,

                            valley in the centre of the state. Most of the valley's residents are Meitei (or Manipuri)
                            people, who today largely adhere to a Vaishnavite strand of Hinduism, but up until the 18th
                            century were casteless animistic worshippers of the sun god Sanamahi. The forested hill
                            country rising up to 2500m outside the central valley is populated predominantly by
                            now-Christian tribal peoples such as the Nagas and Kukis.

                            (‘the abode of clouds’) is a cool, pine-fresh mountain state set on dramatic horseshoes of
                            rocky cliffs. Cherrapunjee and Mawsynram are among the wettest places on Earth; most of the
                            rain falls between June and September, creating very impressive waterfalls and carving out
                            some of Asia’s longest caves.

                            The state's population predominantly comprises the Jaintia, Khasi and Garo tribal groups,
                            who live in the eastern, central and western parts respectively. Though mostly Christian
                            since the 19th century, these peoples still maintain elements of their old animist culture,
                            including fierce clan loyalties, sacred forests where chickens and goats are still
                            sacrificed and lively harvest festivals with mass dances in colourful traditional dress.</p>

                friendly towards visitors. Crowned by Matsue and its original castle, cities are few and far between.

            <p class="citypara">Sprinkled with Islamic and British Raj–era architecture, stuffed with fascinating
                bazaars and famed throughout India for its food, the capital of Uttar Pradesh is something of a sleeper:
                plenty worth seeing, but often overlooked by travelers. Central Lucknow features wide boulevards, epic
                monuments and several parks and gardens that contribute to an atmosphere of faded grandiosity.
                <br>
                The city rose to prominence as the home of the Nawabs of Avadh (Oudh), who were great patrons of the
                culinary and other arts, particularly dance and music. Lucknow’s reputation as a city of culture,
                gracious living and rich cuisine has continued to this day – the phrase for which conveniently rhymes in
                Hindi: Nawab, aadaab (respect), kebab and shabab (beauty).

            <p class="citypara">The beautiful but literally divided island of Mana is about 90 minutes northwest of
                Denarau. It’s home to two upmarket resorts – Mana Island Resort and Tadrai – and a couple of hostels
                next to the village on the southeastern end. A fence, and occasionally a guard, separates the Mana
                Island Resort bure-bunnies from the dorm-dwellers, and signs throughout the resort warn ‘nonguests’ that
                they are not welcome. For their part, the budget spots and their restaurants welcome everyone.
                <br>
                Fence or no fence, the beaches are (mostly) open to all. Walking around the island isn’t really an
                option because of rocky points on the coast, but there are a couple of 20-minute hikes to Sunset Beach
                and to a lookout. There’s plenty of fish-gawking to be had anywhere off the beach, and decent coral off
                Sunset. Check out the south-beach pier for a night snorkel; the fish go into a frenzy under the wharf
                lights.

                And just out of sight, in the arid hill country surrounding the city, is the fairy-tale grandeur of

                If Mumbai is your introduction to India, prepare yourself. The city isn’t a threatening place but its
                furious energy, limited (but improving) public transport and punishing pollution make it challenging for
                visitors. The heart of the city contains some of the most ornate colonial-era architecture on the
                planet, but explore a little more and you’ll uncover unique bazaars, hidden temples, hipster enclaves
                and India’s premier restaurants and nightlife.

                then wait for no further and read on.

                India is a land full of surprises and diversity. It is a country of extremes and this has been well
                experienced and documented by travellers and explorers of the yore as well as of the current times.
                While one can get absolutely mesmerized by the stunning landscapes of the Himalayan foothills, plains,
                coastal region, deserts and forests, the vibrant culture of the country is equally intriguing. In short,
                you can never be fully prepared to travel to India.</p>

                Every man in both countries is a singer when he is happy, and every woman is a dancer when she walks to
                the shop at the corner. For them, food is the music inside the body and music is the food inside the
                heart. ‘Amore’ or ‘Pyar’ makes every man a poet, a princess of peasant girl if only for second eyes of
                man and woman meets. – Gregory David Roberts
